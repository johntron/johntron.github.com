  <div class="entry-content"><p>Expert web developers are hard to find and hard to keep. They operate in an industry in constant flux, survive by constantly reinventing themselves, and thrive on their ability to generalize insight gained through deep understanding and experience. To them, writing code is no longer about solving a problem so much as doing it in a particular way.</p>

<blockquote><p>To the savvy web developer, time constraints, complexity, and technological requirements are no threat – simply another piece of a larger perspective. Software development is not a question of “how”, but rather a question of “in what manner”.</p></blockquote>

<p>The thing that sets expert web developers apart from the crowd – it’s <a title="Tons of crappy freelancers" href="http://www.freelancer.com/" target="_blank">definitely a crowd</a> – is their breadth and depth of knowledge. They understand software down to individual bits and bytes, but they also work well with the human aspects of software like design and usability, teamwork, and business decisions. A single expert can do the work of multiple developers in less time.</p>

<p>With all of this being said, how can you recognize <a title="Johntron! :D" href="http://johntron.com/" target="_self">an expert web developer</a> and work with them to get things done? The first part is easy. If you’ve worked with one, you would have noticed. Just look over their shoulder for a few minutes, and you’ll see windows flicker, hear keys on their keyboard popping like bubble wrap under a steamroller, and smell the burning from their computer’s fan as it struggles just to keep up. Their productivity is magnitudes higher than other developers. They can work by themselves, communicate progress, and adapt to input from coworkers or clients. Some may demand higher pay, but many are just looking for something fun to work on.</p>

<p>There’s also another way to recognize the champions. Because of their abilities, they constantly seek challenges and new frontiers. Unfortunately, many people realize a great web developer after they have left to pursue more interesting work. They leave for many reasons such as too much busy work, lack of freedom, or too many rules and procedures. <em>If they exist in an environment devoid of challenges and inspiration, there is nothing you can do to turn them around</em>. For this reason, it is important to provide challenges and listen carefully.</p>

<p>When you’re working with an expert web developer, getting things done is a matter of accommodating the developer. Frederick Brooks does a great job of explaining what this looks like in his iconic book <em><a title="The Mythical Man Month" href="http://www.amazon.com/Mythical-Man-Month-Software-Engineering-Anniversary/dp/0201835959/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1288154678&sr=8-1" target="_blank">The Mythical Man Month</a></em>. Individuals should operate like members of a surgical team. The expert developer is the surgeon, and members of the design team, copywriters, business analysts, and others surround him ready to provide him with what he needs at any given moment. They take his work and round it out with design assets, documentation, customer service, feedback, and suggestions.</p>

<p>Providing support is important when working with an expert developer, but it’s more important to satiate their craving for new challenges. When they work on the same thing day in and day out, you may notice their productivity slipping, and their general demeanor becoming more complacent. If this happens, you need to act quickly to engage them. One way is by giving them some time to themselves. Let them work on their own ideas. I think you’ll find that the time you’ve given up to them is made up for by increases in productivity. When they have a project they’re interested in, it inspires them, and this inspiration carries over into all of their actions.</p>

<p>Many times expert web developers are simply content with a change of scenery. This may mean moving them to a new project, encourage them to incorporate <a title="new technologies" href="http://github.com/repositories" target="_blank">new technologies</a>, or even just moving the furniture around (literally). Ask them for a prototype of an idea you or your team came up with but never focused on. Buy that latest <a title="Gee-wiz software" href="http://www.panic.com/coda/" target="_blank">gee-wiz software</a> that lets them build widgets in a new way. Buy a couch. Give them gift cards to coffee shops and tell them to work from there. Send them to a <a title="Google I/O" href="http://code.google.com/events/io/" target="_blank">tech conference</a>. Sometimes they might need a breather, so give them a day or two of paid time off.</p>

<p>One of the biggest misconceptions when working with developers is that getting things done is a matter of management – setting deadlines, monitoring progress, adding new team members, having more meetings, etc. While this may be true for novice-level developers, it is just the opposite for the <a title="Joel Spolsky" href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/" target="_blank">hero developers</a>. Their success relies on inspiration, challenges, and mobility. I’ve known a lot of developers personally as well as professionally. A lot of them approach it as job or even a hobby, but the great ones stand out because their approach to software is holistic. Their demeanor is enthusiastic, their hobbies are unique, their style reflects their expert status, and the decisions they make are centered around software. There is no stopping them.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Granting shell access to third-parties can be a security nightmare if done improperly. Even with the best intentions, clients can accidentally delete mission-critical files or shut down crucial services, and clients are the least of your concerns. Servers across the world are constantly attacked by zombie computers. One of the more common forms of attacks are brute force attempts at obtaining shell access through SSH. Servers with plaintext passwords are the first to fall victim to viri, worms, or other nasty intrusions. Here’s how to provide access the correct way.</em></p>

<p>This method provides file transfer access through the SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP – this is different from FTP plus SSL). In addition, it allows third-parties to checkout from (and commit changes to) a Subversion repository. This method does NOT allow SSH shell access, because you should assume granting this kind of privileged access to an unexperienced user is a security risk – at least without further configuration.</p>

<p><strong>Steps to enable SFTP and Subversion access for a user account:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Generate a private-/public-key combination using <code>ssh-keygen</code></li>
<li>Copy public-key to server</li>
<li>Disable password-based authentication (recommended but not required)</li>
<li>Lock the user account</li>
<li>Force the <code>svnserve</code> tunneling daemon to run upon login</li>
<li>Connect to server with SFTP and Subversion</li>
</ol>


<h3>Steps 1 and 2: Generate keys and copy public key to server</h3>

<p>Begin by setting up private-/public- shared SSH authentication keys. There are plenty of tutorials on how to do this, so refer to one of these: <a href="http://oreilly.com/pub/h/66" target="_blank">Quick Logins with ssh Client Keys</a>.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Disable password-based authentication</h3>

<p>This step is not required, but you’ve already bothered with setting up authentication keys. Why not? Passwords will never be sent over the wire. On the upside, keys also make connecting to a server faster (no passwords to type!). To do this, simply edit <code>sshd_config</code> (usually under <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>), change <code>PasswordAuthentication</code> to <code>no</code>, then restart <code>sshd</code> – make sure you can connect with your new keys first!</p>

<h3>Steps 4 and 5: Lock the user account and force <code>svnserve -t</code></h3>

<p>Next, lock the user account and force the svnserve tunneling daemon to run upon login like so: <a href="http://blog.bigsmoke.us/2008/08/04/disabling-ssh-shell-access-for-svn-users-on-a-linuxunix-system" target="_blank">Disabling SSH shell access for SVN users on a Linux/Unix system</a></p>

<h3>Step 6: Connect to server with SFTP and Subversion</h3>

<p>You should now be able to use SFTP to transfer files to and from the server. You must provide a username, but no password will be required (your key will be used instead). For Subversion, repository paths should use the <code>svn+ssh://</code> scheme with a username like so: <code>svn co svn+ssh://myusername@somedomain.com/path/to/repo</code></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Lately I’ve been thinking about success and how it is achieved. I feel that a large part of success is simply being able to produce reasonably accurate statistics that prove your success. 1 million members, 10,000 clicks a day, $1 million in revenue, etc.</p>

<p>I got the idea while I was at the <a href="http://bigdesignconference.com/">Big Design Conference</a> in Dallas, TX. I saw <a href="http://www.poetpainter.com/">Stephen Anderson</a>‘s talk about turning everyday activities into games, and then went to <a href="http://answerlab.com/about/leadership.php/">Amy Buckner</a>‘s talk about web analytics. Competition is like a race to see who can get the most of something. This something can be users, traffic, money, or something else; however, without a number, this information is meaningless.</p>

<p>In our culture, numbers have some serious gusto. They are the deciding factor in everything we do. Do you eat the food that’s cheaper, or the one with less calories? Do we buy the car that gets better MPG or has more horsepower? Do we invest in the company with a better P/E ratio or a larger market share?</p>

<p>Because of this bias, competition between businesses can easily be influenced by metrics. We often hear “Wonkybutz just passed X million users” or “Net profits for Tequilavision just exceeded $1 million”. When these headlines hit the media channels, popular opinion is greatly effected. We read these short phrases with a number in them and subconsciously think, “Well, I guess that means they’re king of the hill now”. The first company to publish a metric with any clout is often deemed reigning champion, or at least an early leader.</p>

<p>Recently, this happened last Wednesday with Apple and Microsoft when <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/27/technology/27apple.html">Apple’s market capitalization exceeded the Redmond folks for the fist time</a>. This news spread like wildfire. People started speculating. Are people going to take Microsoft more seriously now that they’re the underdog? <a href="http://twitter.com/Johntron/statuses/14919022901">I was guilty of this myself</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, metrics are widely misunderstood. It is easy for a company to publish inflated or misleading metrics, and this has powerful implications on popular opinion. Most people don’t understand market capitalization as a metric, and those that do are still effected by its social impact. Capitalization is based on speculation. The total value of Apple’s public shares, in USD, is now greater than Microsofts. It is a stretch to say Apple is now more powerful than Microsoft, because market capitalization is NOT a measure of power or influence. <a href="http://blogs.computerworld.com/16214/is_apple_really_more_valuable_than_microsoft">Sharon Machlis</a> does a good job at pointing out the facts.</p>

<p>So much of our lives is based on numbers. Science is driven ever further towards a better future because of measurability. The tides of our economy rise and fall in unison with popular metrics. Online culture is at the mercy of analytics. When we’re surrounded by numbers on a daily basis, it’s easy to get lost in them. We must constantly remind ourselves: “This is just a number. What does it really mean?”.</p>

<p>Django 1.2 will contain support for multiple databases, according to <a href="http://simonwillison.net/static/2009/djugl-december.html">Simon Willison</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/simonw/">@simonw</a>). Good news for people trying to scale their web application or building intranet services.</p>

<p>This addition means you will be able to do the following:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p style="margin-top: 5px;">
  After reading <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2009/12/06/study-people-who-buy.html">Boing Boing’s report on counterfeit bags</a>, I realized Professor Gosline may be stumbling onto something with huge implications.
</p>


<p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 125%; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;">I think about piracy – a lot. I feel most people are honest and are willing to pay for good products. I don’t think this is necessarily a bad thing for business.</span></p>

<p>Early adoption is the key to market share. Some wise person (Will Shipley?) said you should give your software away to 90% of your users, and then sell it to the other 10% <img src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/arrow.png" alt="arrow" title="arrow" width="46" style="left:-20px; position:relative; top:4px; vertical-align:top;" /></p>

<div style="float:left; font-weight:bold; margin: 0 171px -30px 20px; position:relative; text-align:justify; top:-48px; font-family: Verdana;">
  Gain market share, then sell it to the largest market possible. In the product life cycle, the trend starts with early adopters. I think this applies to and individual’s experience with a product as well.
</div>


<p>People who cannot afford to comfortably buy a product are probably not going to buy it. They’re going to pirate it. Thus the company unknowingly and unwillingly gives the user something for free. The user is probably not going to feel good about this, so later on, when things improve for them financially, they’ll probably end up purchasing the real deal.</p>

<p>Possibly the worst thing you can do is sue your users, but you also don’t want to publicly approve of this strategy, because. Then you eliminate the guilt that leads to reciprocity. <em>Pirates are very strong potential customers, and it’s cheaper, more practical, and possibly more profitable to</em> NOT <em>sue them and hope for a sale later.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/"><img alt="Adobe Photoshop" src="http://www.adobe.com/images/shared/product_mnemonics/48x45/photoshop_cs4_48x45.gif" title="Adobe Photoshop" style="float:left; margin-right:12px;" width="48" height="45" /></a>Adobe’s products are a good example. Most students cannot afford them (even with a massive student discount), so they pirate the software instead (possibly for years). Most people I know have a good experience with Adobe’s products, economic issues aside. They know it’s great software, and they’ll eventually want to return the favor.</p>

<p>So if you have a good product that adds real value to peoples’ lives, quit worrying about pirates. They’ll come around.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Quit banging your head and learn to debug your Python web application using an interactive stack trace. If you use Apache with mod_wsgi to host a Python application, it is possible to use the Python Debugger (pdb) to trace your code through the console. I use this three-step method to debug my Django projects. I thought about using the <a href="http://rob.cogit8.org/blog/2008/Sep/19/introducing-django-debug-toolbar/">Django Debug Toolbar</a>, but this can only be used in HTML responses. For instance, JSON, XML, or Plaintext responses cannot be debugged with the toolbar.</p>

<h2>Step one: Wrap your WSGI application in a Debugger class</h2>

<p>Edit your WSGI script (specified in your Apache configuration file) to wrap your WSGI application in a Debugger class.<br/>
[python]import os<br/>
import sys</p>

<p>sys.path.append( ‘/www/yourproject’ )<br/>
os.environ[&#8216;DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE&#8217;] = ‘settings’<br/>
import django.core.handlers.wsgi<br/>
import settings</p>

<p>if settings.INTERACTIVE_DEBUG:<br/>
class Debugger:</p>

<p>def __init__(self, object):<br/>
self.__object = object</p>

<p>def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):<br/>
import pdb, sys<br/>
debugger = pdb.Pdb()<br/>
debugger.use_rawinput = 0<br/>
debugger.reset()<br/>
sys.settrace(debugger.trace_dispatch)</p>

<p>try:<br/>
return self.__object(*args, **kwargs)<br/>
finally:<br/>
debugger.quitting = 1<br/>
sys.settrace(None)</p>

<p>application = Debugger( django.core.handlers.wsgi.WSGIHandler() )<br/>
else:<br/>
application = django.core.handlers.wsgi.WSGIHandler()[/python]<br/>
See <a href="http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/DebuggingTechniques">modwsgi Debugging Techniques</a> (and scroll down quite a bit) for more information.</p>

<h2>Step two: Add INTERACTIVE_DEBUG to settings</h2>

<p>In your settings.py file, add the following just below <em>DEBUG = True</em>:<br/>
<code>INTERACTIVE_DEBUG = True</code></p>

<h2>Step two: Restart Apache in interactive mode</h2>

<p>In your console (as root) type the following:</p>

<p>[bash]apache2ctl stop<br/>
apache2ctl -X<br/>
[/bash]</p>

<p>This should appear to hang. It’s actually just waiting for you to load a page. Move on.</p>

<h2>Step three: Request a webpage</h2>

<p>Now, just request a webpage from your server like normal and notice your browser hanging now as well. This is because the Python Debugger (pdb) is waiting for input from you. If you switch back to your console, you should see a pdb prompt. From this point on, you can issue pdb commands in the interactive pdb prompt like you would for any Python application. See <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/pdb.html#debugger-commands">pdb commands</a> for more info.</p>

<p>Here’s a list of the most common commands:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>b myproject/app/file.py:23</strong> – Set breakpoint on line 23 of myproject/app/file.py (should be in your python path)</li>
<li><strong>c</strong> – Continue and stop at any breakpoints you’ve set</li>
<li><strong>w</strong> – Show backtrace to current position</li>
<li><strong>l</strong> – List sourcecode in current file</li>
<li><strong>s</strong> – Continue and stop at next possible occasion</li>
<li><strong>n</strong> – Continue and stop at next line of current function or when function returns</li>
<li><strong>print var</strong> – Print’s python variable <em>var</em></li>
</ul>


<p>In addition to these commands, you can also run any Python code as long as they don’t conflict with these commands.</p>

<p>If this helps, be sure to leave a comment. Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>Updated 23 Nov 2010: </strong>Added INTERACTIVE_DEBUG feature.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here’s a fix for the Pirate Bay torrents. The primary tracker over at <a href="http://thepiratebay.org/">The Pirate Bay</a> doesn’t seem to be working. As a workaround, I’ve create a simple script to replace torrent files downloaded form TPB to work with one of their secondary trackers (tracker.openbittorrent.com).</p>

<p>To use the script, just upload the torrent you got from TPB, hit submit, and it’ll prompt you to save the converted file. The source code of the script can be found <a href="/tpb-fix.txt">here</a> for the paranoid types.</p>

<p>Enough already, take me to the <a href="/tpb-fix.php">Pirate Bay torrent fixer</a>!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I like to think of myself as a “poweruser”. One of the things I do is aggregate RSS feeds from all over, and read them in Google Reader on my Macbook, and in Feeds on my iPhone. After doing this for some time now, I’ve realized there are a few issues that really tick me off when reading (or choosing not to read) some blogs. Below I’ve outlined some of these issues.</p>

<h3>Publish an RSS feed</h3>

<p>If you provide updates regularly, and anyone cares about them, publish an RSS feed. There’s no excuse for not publishing one. With WordPress and the abundance of opensource scripts, there’s no reason you shouldn’t publish one.</p>

<h3>Use descriptive titles</h3>

<p>Users do not want to have to go to your site to see what an article is about, that’s why they’re using RSS. Don’t piss off your users just to get them to come to your site.</h3></p>

<h3>Publish summaries for every feed item, even videos and pictures</h3>

<p>This follows the same reasoning as using descriptive titles. Users might not want to or be able to look at pictures or videos directly from their RSS reader. Provide a concise description so users can decide whether or not they want to view the article; otherwise, they’ll probably default to not viewing it.</p>

<h3>Link directly to the feed item, not the homepage</h3>

<p>Probably one of the most frustrating things is click into an article, and being sent to the feed’s homepage. The user is then forced to hunt down the article, or, more likely, not read it. Always always always, link directly to the article, and not to the homepage, a category page, or any other page. Also, link directly to the <em>full</em> article, not a summary, or a slimmed down one.</p>

<h3>Publish videos in the most common format or multiple formats</h3>

<p>There are no video formats that are supported on every single device on the market, but there are some pretty popular ones. I recommend publishing videos to Youtube, and also offering a version in H.264 MP4. Always publish audio using the MP3 format.</p>

<p>Here are the video specifications for the iphone:</p>

<blockquote><p>Video formats supported: H.264 video, up to 1.5 Mbps, 640 by 480 pixels, 30 frames per second, Low-Complexity version of the H.264 Baseline Profile with AAC-LC audio up to 160 Kbps, 48kHz, stereo audio in .m4v, .mp4, and .mov file formats; H.264 video, up to 2.5 Mbps, 640 by 480 pixels, 30 frames per second, Baseline Profile up to Level 3.0 with AAC-LC audio up to 160 Kbps, 48kHz, stereo audio in .m4v, .mp4, and .mov file formats; MPEG-4 video, up to 2.5 Mbps, 640 by 480 pixels, 30 frames per second, Simple Profile with AAC-LC audio up to 160 Kbps, 48kHz, stereo audio in .m4v, .mp4, and .mov file formats</p></blockquote>

<p>And here’s the video specifications for the Blackberry Tour (newest Blackberry at time of writing):</p>

<blockquote><p>Video format support: MPEG4 H.263, MPEG4 Part 2 Simple Profile, H.264 (encoding and decoding 30fps), WMV</p></blockquote>

<h3>Show the date</h3>

<p>Nobody likes reading an article, then realizing it’s years old. Always publish the date in your RSS feed and on your HTML pages. On your HTML pages, place the date somewhere between the title and the content. This way, a reader knows what they’re getting themselves into before they start reading.</p>

<h3>Use RSS autodiscovery and provide obvious links just in case</h3>

<p>Provide an RSS autodiscovery link to help users aggregate your feed. If you do this, most modern software can figure out the full RSS URL on it’s own.</p>

<p>Here’s what mine looks like:</p>

<blockquote><p><link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" title="Johntron Speaks RSS Feed" href="http://www.johntron.com/feed/" /></p></blockquote>

<p>Anywho, I hope this helps someone. As always, please leave comments, suggestions, corrections, etc.</p>
