In this post I want to focus more on the larger problem of collaboration. Fred Brooks laid the foundation for this topic in <a style="font-style: italic;" title="Mythical Man Month" href="http://www.amazon.com/Mythical-Man-Month-Software-Engineering-Anniversary/dp/0201835959" target="_blank">Mythical Man Month: Essays on Software Engineering</a>, and Eric S.

Since then, there has been much debate over this topic. Let’s start by understanding the problem, and then try to figure out what makes up a successful large-scale project.</p>

</ul>


<p>Read on if you’re still interested.</p>

<h2>The Problem: Brooks Law</h2>

<p>Group dynamics are responsible for the success or failure of any large scale software project. If a project cannot organize in a sustainable way, its failure is simply a matter of time. Long ago, people thought software development was like manufacturing. Many believe productivity is based on how many workers you have. Using this logic, larger projects require more people, and the best way to expedite a project is to simply add more workers, right? Wrong. According to Brooks, “adding manpower to a late software project makes it later”. This is known as Brooks Law. (I like the alternative form: “Nine women can’t make a baby in one month”). While Brooks himself admits this is a simplification, it helps us to understand the issue. Project management is a problem of communication.</p>

<p>Adding new members to a team requires more communication, and communication takes time. Communication is also exponential. Adding one new member to a team of three people means that three people each communicating with two others (six connections) becomes four people communicating with three others (12 connections). A team of 100 members means 9,900 connections. Can you imagine trying to get work done when you have 99 people all trying to tell you something, and each one of those has the same problem? OK, granted this is an oversimplification, but it is based around historical logic.</p>

<p>The other issue with large scale projects is they are broad in scope by definition. This means it is difficult for any one person to understand how every detail of the entire project functions, so team members tend to curate specific portions of the project. Adding one member to a one-man team means he has to get a knowledge dump from him (this is notoriously time consuming and rarely effective), but adding another member to the team means this new member has to get his knowledge from two sources. Again, communication shows it’s exponential nature.</p>

<h2>The Surgical Team and the Gorilla</h2>

<p>Now that we understand the problem, let’s look at Brooks solution – the surgical team. Brooks believes large scale projects work best when organized like a surgical team. You have one very highly skilled person (or at least a very small group of people) at the center, with a staff of assistants there to do his bidding. The surgeon is responsible for getting things done, but his work load is offloaded by his team of supporters. He is the one getting things done, while everyone else gets him the tools he needs, provides input, makes sure he doesn’t screw up, and cleans up after him. In software development, this means the expert developer is the only one modifying the code, while his team gives him patches, points out bugs or problems with his logic, runs tests, and writes documentation.</p>

<p>I really like Brooks idea, mainly for egotistical reasons, but there’s an 800-pound gorilla in the room. If Brooks ideas are correct, how can Linux, or any large-scale open source project exist? This is where Eric Raymond helps out. He believes that these projects are successful because of their openness and the simple fact that there are so many people watching. Raymond would call Brooks idea of the surgical team analogous to the monolithic nature of cathedrals – one point controlling a broad empire. Linux on the other hand is believed to operate like something more similar to a bazaar – many forces working independently. When people work independently on one project, problems are discovered more quickly. Linus’s Law: “given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow”. This means bugfixes and new features are created by smaller groups of individuals and then assimilated into the shared codebase. Raymond’s argument played a key role in AOL releasing the code for their browser, Netscape, to the public as well as the open-sourcing of other key components of today’s Linux operating system.</p>

<h2>Linux’s Has a Surgeon, But He’s Kind of Lazy</h2>

<p>With two differing opinions, who is right? I think they both are. While we would like to believe the power of collective intelligence as depicted by Raymond, in reality, large scale open source projects aren’t so distributed. While they are indeed a collaborative effort among tens, hundreds, or even thousands of people, there are still gatekeepers. Linus Torvalds, father of the Linux operating system is perhaps the biggest example of this. Linus is the only person that can make changes to the “official” set of code. Everything goes through him; however, this doesn’t mean he’s living in some dark corner writing code all day every day. In fact, he writes very little code. Instead, he reviews patches that have been handed to him after getting through the screening process of many different developers.</p>

<p>A patch created by some anonymous contributor can get picked up, evaluated, passed on towards Linus, possibly revised, and eventually either ending up at Linus or abandoned. Then, Linus evaluates the patch using his high-level understanding of the entire project, applies it, and distributes his changes to everyone. Everyone then incorporates these changes and tests them. Because so many people are viewing the project, even the deepest bugs are discovered almost immediately. Bugfixes are then submitted through the same process. The community that supports the project also offers the other key role of creating a feedback loop. This kind of group dynamics and organization is seen in many other projects. Most of them have more than one core developer; however, there is typically a very small group of people working in concert with a broad community of contributors and testers. This is similar to Brook’s argument, but the feedback is important. If we modified his idea of the surgical team, it would be as though the staff supporting the surgeon each have their own patient receiving the same treatment, but if any one of them notices a problem, they can notify the surgeon and appropriate actions will be taken.</p>

<h2>Meritocracy and The Cuddle Death</h2>

<p>If you’ve made it this far, you must be really interested in this topic. I’d like to offer a new analogy: bees. A hive of bees operate in the same way as the Linux project. A single queen bee plays the key role of maintaing the rest of the group, while the rest of the group provides everything she needs to keep having little baby bees. These baby bees evolve into grown-ass bees and in turn contribute to the hive. OK, so it’s not a perfect analogy, but neither is the bazaar, the cathedral, or the surgical team. With this analogy, we can also see how a project might survive if the “queen” dies or in some way quits fulfilling the wishes of the hive. When a queen dies, the worker bees have typically already begun incubating new queen bees to replace her. Workers feed these soon-to-be queens a strict diet of royal jelly. This substance allows normal bees to develop into queens (ie: magic). The first new queen to hatch then goes and kills the other queens, and sometimes the old queen bee before taking her throne. If the old queen is still alive, and the new queen doesn’t kill her, the hive kills the old queen in something with a cute name called “cuddle death” (the workers press against her from all sides until she overheats and dies).</p>

<p>The same thing can happen in open source projects. If the community doesn’t like what the core developers are doing, they can either start their own projects and operate separately from the original (something known as swarming in bee-ology), or they can replace the core team with one that meets their needs.
